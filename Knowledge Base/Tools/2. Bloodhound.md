## What is Bloodhound?
- Bloodhound is a `data analysis tool` and needs data to be useful.
- Bloodhound uses `graph theory` to reveal hidden and unintended relationships within an Active Directory environment.
- Attackers can use BloodHound to easily identify complex attack paths that woul otherwise be difficult to identify.
	- This tool can be used to easily gain a deeper understanding of privilege relationships in an AD environment.


### Data Collection for Bloodhound
- SharpHound is the official data collector for Bloodhound.
	- It is written in C# and uses native Windows API functions and LDAP namespace functions to collect info from domain controllers and domain-joined Windows systems.

SharpHound will automatically determine what domain your current user belongs to.
- The default collection method will collect all pieces of user information from the DC
		1. Security Group Memberships.
		2. Domain Trusts.
		3. Abusable rights on AD objects.
		4. OU tree structure.
		5. Several properties from computer, groups and user objects.

- Additionally SharpHound will also collect info from each domain joined user computers like:
1. Members of local admins, remote desktop, remote management groups etc.
2. Active sessions which sharphound will attempt to corelate systems where users are collectively logged on

When finished, SharpHound will create several JSON files and place them into a ZIP file. 

### Miscellaneous Looping in Bloodhound.
- This knowledge will not be useful now, as Opsec is important but important in the future for Active Directory pentests

## The Session Loop Collection Method[](https://bloodhound.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data-collection/sharphound.html#the-session-loop-collection-method "Permalink to this headline")

BloodHound uses graph theory to find attack paths in Active Directory, and the more data you have, the more likely you are to find and execute attack paths successfully. Much of the data you initially collect with SharpHound will not likely change or require updating over the course of a typical red team assessment - security group memberships, Active Directory permissions, and Group Policy links change relatively rarely. That data can be collected one time, and not again.

User sessions are different for two reasons:

1. Users, especially privileged users, log on and off different systems all day, every day. How many systems does a typical help desk user or server admin log into on any given day?

2. The [way SharpHound’s data collection works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q86VgM2Tafc) necessitates scanning the network several times to get more complete session information. Scannning the network one time for user sessions may give you between 5 and 15% of the actual sessions on the network.

When you use the path finding function query in BloodHound to find a path between two nodes and see that there is no path, 9 times out of 10 this is because BloodHound needs more session data.

SharpHound’s Session Loop collection method makes this very easy:

C:\> SharpHound.exe --CollectionMethods Session --Loop

This will run SharpHound’s session collection method for 2 hours, generating a zip file after each loop ends. When done, collect all the zip files and drag and drop them into the BloodHound GUI.

If you would like to specify a different loop time, use the –Loopduration flag with the HH:MM:SS format to specify how long you want SharpHound to perform looped session collection for. For example, if you want SharpHound to perform looped session collection for 3 hours, 9 minutes and 41 seconds:

C:\> SharpHound.exe --CollectionMethods Session --Loop --Loopduration 03:09:41
