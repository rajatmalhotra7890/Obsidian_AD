- SCP is a program for copying files between computers.
- It uses `ssh` protocol solely. So the target must have ssh enabled on it for this file transfer method to be successful.


### Basic syntax
```shell
scp file host:path
```
- This copies the file to remote host 
- The destination path is optional, but can be a directory on the server or even a filename if copying a single file.


To copy  a file from remote host, we use
```shell
scp host:file path
```
- This fetches a file from host, and puts it in the directory indicated by the path.



### To copy whole directories instead of a single file add thr `-r` flag
- To copy file to a remote host
```shell
scp -r file host:path
```

or to copy files from a remote host 
```shell
scp -r host:file path
```


### Copy a local file to a remote system using scp
```shell
scp file user@<target-ip>:/where/to/put/it
```
- Here file is the local file which is transferred to the remote host
- Here user is the username we are targetting and the IP just like we do in SSH.

### If SSH is not running on a port 22 by default, we use `-P` flag to specify the remote port
```shell
scp -P 2332 file user@{destination-ip}:/where/to/put/it
```

### To copy  a local directory to a  remote host
```shell
scp -r -P 2322 /directory user@{destination-ip}:/remote/directory
```
