- Conditions to use sshuttle on a machine
```
1. Must have Python3 installed on target
2. Have SSH access to target machine (privileges  dont matter sudo or root access is fine)
```


## Install sshuttle on machine
```
sudo apt install sshuttle
```


# Forward all traffic
```
sshuttle -r username@sshserver 0.0.0.0/0
```
- Use the `sshuttle -r` parameter to specify a remote server (target) 

Example
```
sshuttle -r user@<target-ip> <internal subnet to forward our traffic to>
```

```
sshuttle -r user@192.168.1.140 192.168.2.0/24
```
- So this establishes a VPN connection to the internal resources!

We can run commands normally as we run in Kali with the surety that we can access the internal resources on the target subnetwork.

To mention a file, when using sshuttle
```
sshuttle -r user@172.16.0.5 --ssh-cmd "ssh -i private_key" 172.16.0.0/24
```

### Note -  We dont even need to setup foxyproxy here in this case as we already established a VPN connection using SSH to the internal network and hence we can access internal resources.
