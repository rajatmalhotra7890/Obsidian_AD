## 1. Metasploit uses a Proxy server as a part of its Post Exploitation tool suite which we will see

### Step 1 - Get a meterpreter reverse shell on the target machine.

### Step 2 -  Now background the current session, then search for post exploitation module called autoroute.

#### Background about autoroute module 
- This module is used to add routes associated with the current meterpreter session using Metasploit's routing table.
- These routes can be used to pivot to private networks and resources that can be accessed by the compromised machine.
	- This module can search for routes (from network interfaces of the compromised host) and add them automatically
	- Routes can be added, deleted or displayed manually.

#### Now there are several CMD options for this module that control the module's behaviour.
1. autoadd 
- When this option is used, the module searches compromised machine's routing table and network interface list looking for networks that the machine can access.
- Once found module automatically adds routes to the Metasploit's routing table.

2. add
- This option is used to manually add routes to Metasploit's routing table.
- Set the options before running the module in the current meterpreter session.
- Session number is also required to be inputted before running this post exploitation module.

3. print
- This cmd option is used to display Metasploit's routing table.
- Commmand used `route print`


## Step 3 - Pivoting using a SOCKS4/SOCKS5 proxy server
- Metasploit can launch a Socks4 proxy server using the module `auxiliary/server/socks4a`.
- When set up to bind to a local loopback adapter, applications can be directed to use the proxy route TCP/IP traffic through Metasploit's routing tables.

3.1 Steps to launch the SOCKS4a module in Msfconsole
```
use auxiliary/server/socks_proxy

set SRVHOST 127.0.0.1

set SRVPORT 1080

exploit -j
```

## Step 4 - Proxychains setup
- We need to make sure we have the tool called `Proxychains`.

```shell
sudo apt install proxychains
```
- Now edit the proxychains.conf file which is the configuration file for Proxychains.
- At the end of the file, we need to add the following line 

```
socks4 127.0.0.1 1080
```


#### You can now run any normal commands or tools that you want and it will be forwarded through the proxy chain if you append your tool or command with “proxychains”.

Example
```
proxychains nmap -sT -Pn <target> <options>
proxychains ping 10.200.x.0/24
proxychains ssh user@ip 

and so on...
```


## Step 5 - Firefox proxy setup using Foxyproxy
- Now that we have a proxy setup to forward out traffic through, we need a way to easily access resources on the network.
- We use foxyproxy to setup the proxy.

- So if a web server is running on any of the networks' internal machines then we can browse it here by turning on this `Throwback Proxy`
