In Windows, “Token Impersonation” is when a new token is assigned to a thread that is different from the parent process's token. Although the word impersonation implies that one user is using a token belonging to a different user, this is not always the case. A user may impersonate a token that belongs to them but simply has a different set of privileges or some other modifications.


# Another Explanation
Similar to web cookies, token are temporary keys that allow for sessions to be ‘remembered’ for periods of time, rather than requiring reauthentication at every instance of accessing a network service or system. These tokens persist until reboot, allowing for incredible shenanigans, especially on rarely rebooted domain controllers such as domain controllers. Originally a stand-alone program, Incognito is bundled-in with the meterpreter shell, allowing for us to use saved tokens as we please once we have a meterpreter session. In this section, we’ll explore how to abuse these tokens further with Incognito. When looking for tokens to impersonate you want to look for administrator or system tokens for more information on token delegation look [here](https://www.exploit-db.com/papers/42556).
