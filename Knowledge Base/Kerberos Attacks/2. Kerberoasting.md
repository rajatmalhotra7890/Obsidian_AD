Before we understand what is this, first we need to clear out our basics


#### Let's start with a SPN (Service Principal Name)
- A Service Principal Name is a unique identifier of a service instance.
- SPNs are used by Kerberos authentication to associate a `service instance` with a `logon account`
- This allows a client application to request that the service authenticate an account even if the client doesnt have the account name.
- If you install multiple instances of a service on computers throughout the forest, each instance must have its own SPN.



### Format of an SPN
```
Sevice-name/machine-name@realm.local

Example
MSSQLsvc/hostsql1@domain.local
```
