- In the first step of Kerberos authentication, the client is going to send a request to KDC for a TGT.
- In that request (AS-REQ), the client will be sending an encrypted timestamp, encrypted with the user's password
- Once the KDC receives the encrypted timestamp, its going to decrypt the timestamp with the user's password.

This will verify two things:
1. The client is the only one making the request
2. The client wont be able to try a ticket replay attack

- If the timestamp is within the KDC's predefined time-frame (not more than a few minutes) then the KDC will send back a AS-REP reply along with a TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket) for the client only
	- This reply will also contain some data which is encrypted with the client's password.
	- If we were able to get a hold of this AS-REP reply from KDC, we could brute-force the encryped part of data sent by KDC, encrypted with the client's password and know the client's password 


### What causes this attack / AS-REP roasting?
- `If the pre-authentication is disabled for the user's account, then in the first step, a plain request will be only be sent for the TGT to the KDC, without any encryted timestamp from the client.`
- `The KDC wont have to verify the encrypted timestamp so we dont need to know the password of the user but we simply get the TGT (encrypted with the client/user's password) of the user which we can use Hascat or John The Ripper to crack that hash and ultimately get the user's password.`


### Where can we change the setting for pre-authentication?

In Windows Server OS,
```
Server Manager -> Tools -> Active Directory Users and Computers -> Users (OU) -> (Click on any user's account) -> Account -> Account Options -> Do not require Kerberos preauthentication
```


### Tools used for AS-REP 

Impacket -  GetNPUsers.py script

```shell
GetNPUsers.py throwback.local/jsmith -dc-ip=<ip of domain controller>
```
- We get the encryped TGT of the user `jsmith` which we can crack offline using tools



# What do we need for this attack?
1. `A list of users which may/may not have pre-authentication disbaled on their accounts`
2. `A way to communicate with the Domain Controller possibly using a reverse proxy like proxychains or chisel`
