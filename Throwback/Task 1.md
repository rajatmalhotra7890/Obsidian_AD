### What is Throwback?
- Throwback is an Active Directory (AD) lab that teaches the fundamentals and core concepts of attacking a Windows network. 
- The network simulates a realistic corporate environment that has several attack vectors you would expect to find in today’s organisations.

Note - The lab uses a structured, hand-held approach to guide users through exploiting the network. The use of Windows to manage authentication and user identities in IT infrastructure today is so commonly used; as an aspiring security practitioner, it’s crucial to understand how this works and the network’s common weaknesses.



### What do we learn
You will explore the following attacks:

    Phishing & OSINT
    Offensive Powershell
    Active Directory Basics
    Kerberos Abuse
    Custom Malicious Macros
    Active Directory Enumeration & Exploitation
    Attacking Mail Servers
    Firewall Pivoting
    C2 Frameworks
    Abusing Cross-Domain Trusts


### Accessing the Network
To access the network, you will need to first connect to our network using OpenVPN. Here is a mini walkthrough of connecting to the Throwback-specific network. You can also use the web-based Kali Linux or Kali Linux machine.
