# Blackbox vs. Whitebox

- Welcome to the Throwback Network! 
- Similar to the start of many games, you must choose how you will tackle the challenges to come. But fear not brave adventurer, you may ask for help as you explore or adjust your difficulty at any time. These difficulties come in two flavors: Black Box and White Box


## Blackbox Approach
- In the Black Box approach only the first few tasks (one through three) matter. Pwn the network and claim your destiny. Capture all of the flags available and gain your certificate. (WIP for tasks, at the time of writing you must complete all tasks in the room)


### Whitebox Approach
- Journey with a guide and follow the tasks laid out to you in order. Learn and gain experience, explore the throwback dungeon, and grow as you progress.
